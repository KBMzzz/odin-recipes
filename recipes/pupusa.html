</ul>

<strong>Steps</strong>

<ol>
    <li>Add masa harina (corn flour) and salt to a large mixing bowl. </li>
    <li>Add the warm water, little by little, mixing the dough with your hand. You may not need all of the water. You want the masa to be the consistency of a soft play dough. If the dough is too wet, mix in some more masa harina. If it’s too dry, 
        add a little more water. Mix in butter and chicken bouillon, if using.</li>
    <li>Scoop the dough into large, golf-ball-size portions. You can scoop all of the dough into balls before continuing, or make 1 pupusa at a time. Be sure to keep the dough covered with a damp cloth as you work,
         to keep it from drying out.</li>
    <li>Use the palms of your hands to pat the dough into a disc, about 4 inches in diameter.
    </li>
    <li>Scoop about half a tablespoon of the beans and place it in the center of the dough circle, followed by a pinch of shredded cheese. </li>
    <li>Gently bring the edges of the dough up and around the filling, pinching it closed into a ball. Gently pat the dough between your palms to form it into a disc again.
        Be gentle so you don’t have big cracks of filling come through, but if you do have some, its fine! They don’t need to be perfect 🙂</li>
    <li>Heat a large ungreased skillet or pan over medium heat. Place pupusas on the hot pan and cook for about 2-4 minutes on each side. You will know the pupusas are ready to flip when the edges are set and the bottom is lightly golden.</li>
    <li>Serve immediately, topped with Curtido and Salsa Roja.</li>
</ol>
